There is much to be done...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Must do for ~1.0:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Make message system non-crap: elite rating increase message should have
 sender, messages should have priority and have viewable log. support for
 message sender image
* Autopilot to adequate standard
* Internal engine fuel usage (refuel on inventory page)
~ Textual system descriptions
* Shipyard:
 * Repairs, servicing
 * Hyperspace range and more stats when viewing ships for sale
* Cargo scooping
* Fuel scooping
* Military standing, legal status, police
* More ship equipment...
~ Bulletin board............


Less crucial things:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Sfx look utterly shit
* Make scanner only appear at appropriate times
* Planet twinkles are the colour of the 1st star in the system, not closest or combination
* Star light should attenuate
