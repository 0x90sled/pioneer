There is much to be done...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Get rid of sbre object caching (or fix it) because it is broken with LOD.
* Make scanner only appear at appropriate times
* Make sure custom systems without body definitions have the stars specified
 - Perhaps use partial system definitions where stars are defined but planets are generated
* Precise selection of hyperspace destination (by planet, not just system).
* Internal engine fuel usage (refuel on inventory page)
* Political alignments of systems (probably needed for trade model):
 * Piracy level
 * Textual system descriptions
 * System extended info (demographics, sector, sysnum, allegiance, ...)
* Spawn pirates on entry to system.
* Pilot rating by kills *cough*
* Finish crap trade model (illegal goods, ...)
* Hyperspace range enforced, fuel usage.
* Planet twinkles are the colour of the 1st star in the system, not closest or combination
* Star light should attenuate
* Shipyard:
 * Repairs, servicing
 * Buy ship
* Cargo scooping
* Fuel scooping
* Galactic map, galaxy star density scam
* Criminal record, military standing, legal status, police
* More ship equipment...
* Bulletin board............
