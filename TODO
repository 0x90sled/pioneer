Art needed:
~~~~~~~~~~~

3D models:
	At least 25 ships of various sizes and functions
	All kinds of random models to stick on cities on planets

	Little bits of debris for explosions
2D:
	Decent icons for the ship control panel
	Identikit faces for the space station comms interface

Sound effects:
	The ones I made are awful.
	Need sliding and grinding noises for lifts and doors and stuff,
