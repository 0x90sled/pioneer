Compiling ODE for Pioneer:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Pioneer wants ODE v 0.10. Don't use that crusty old 0.9 you see on the offical
ODE website. Instead get 0.10 from the sourceforge page:

http://sourceforge.net/projects/opende

Pioneer is very picky about how you compile the ODE library. On unix you
should compile ODE like so:

./configure --enable-double-precision --disable-asserts --enable-new-trimesh
make
make install

--enable-double-precision and --enable-new-trimesh are essential. It will not
compile without the former, and collisions will go totally mental without
the latter.
