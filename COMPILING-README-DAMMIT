Compiling ODE for Pioneer:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Pioneer wants ODE v 0.10.2 or later. Versions before that have a triangle
mesh collision bug that makes pioneer crash a lot. (This bug was fixed in
svn on 2008-08-08 and at the time of writing 0.10.2 has not actually been
tagged yet).

Pioneer is very picky about how you compile the ODE library. On unix you
should compile ODE like so:

./configure --enable-double-precision --enable-new-trimesh
make
make install

--enable-double-precision and --enable-new-trimesh are essential. Pioneer will
not compile without the former, and collisions will go totally mental without
the latter.
