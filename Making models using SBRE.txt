Making models using SBRE
========================

Look at examples in src/sbre/models.cpp

SBRE models are made of 4 things:

* Plain vertices
* Compound vertices
* Model bytecode
* Model definition


Plain vertices:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Plain vertices have type, and float x,y,z components.

valid types:
	VTYPE_PLAIN. Vertex will be unchanged.
	VTYPE_DIR. Vertex will be normalized.

Compound vertices:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

blah

Model Definition:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

blah

Model bytecode:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

PTYPE_SETCFLAG

	Args: flag

	Set collision mesh flag for geometry created after this point.

	Pioneer uses these flag values:
		For starports:
		0x10 indicates starport
		0x10 - 1st docking port
		0x11 - 2nd docking port
		0x12 - 3rd docking port
		0x13 - 4th docking port

Some Pioneer Model Conventions:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Objects which sit in a rotating frame (ie orbital starports) rotate in
the Y axis.
